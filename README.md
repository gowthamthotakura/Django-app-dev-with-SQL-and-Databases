Adding a New Assessment Feature to an Online Course App

Implemented the new assessment improvements in the application:

Create Question, Choice, and Submission models.
Create a new course object with exam-related models using the admin site.
Update the course details template to show questions and choices.
Create a new exam result template to show the submission results.
Create a new exam result submission view.
Create a new view to display and evaluate the exam result.


Goal:

I understand the requirements for obtaining and testing a code template for the course assessment feature. I have efficiently implemented these features, ensuring requirements alignment while maintaining good project organisation and documentation.
